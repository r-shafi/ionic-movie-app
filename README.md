## About

Open Movie Tracker is a free, open-source Android app for discovering and tracking movies and TV shows — a privacy-first alternative to apps like Letterboxd. No account or sign-in is required; all your data — watched history, ratings, reviews, watchlist, favorites, custom lists, and profile settings — is stored **locally on your device**. The app supports both movies **and** TV shows, including season and episode-level tracking. All metadata is sourced from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS, 18+)
- npm (or pnpm — the project uses a pnpm lockfile)
- Android Studio (for building and running on Android)
- JDK 17+ (for Android builds)
- A TMDb API key (free — [register here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r-shafi/open-movie-tracker.git
cd open-movie-tracker
pnpm install
```

### TMDb API Key Setup

1. Get an API key from [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
2. Open `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
3. Replace the `tmdbApiKey` value with your key:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  tmdbApiKey: 'your_api_key_here',
  tmdbBaseUrl: 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3',
  tmdbImageBase: 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p',
};
```

> The development and production files share the same TMDb API key. Both must be updated.

### Run in Browser

```bash
npm run start
# or: ionic serve
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8100`. Note: Capacitor plugins (network, haptics, etc.) may not work in the browser — the app falls back gracefully.

### Run on Android

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

Then click **Run** in Android Studio.

## CI/CD & Releases

Three GitHub Actions workflows power the release pipeline:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — triggers on every push and pull request to `main`. Runs ESLint linting, production Angular build (smoke test), and validates version codes.
- **Release Please** (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`) — triggers on push to `main`. Automatically creates and updates a "Release PR" as conventional commits accumulate. Merging the Release PR bumps the version, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, and tags the release.
- **Build & Release APK** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — triggered by a `v*.*.*` tag. Builds a signed production APK, renames it to `open-movie-tracker-{TAG}.apk`, and attaches it to the GitHub Release.

The signed APK is available on every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/r-shafi/open-movie-tracker/releases).
